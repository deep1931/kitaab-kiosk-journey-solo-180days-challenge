# Day 1 — The Idea: My 180-Day Journey to Build Kitaab Kiosk

**Date:** 27 Oct 2025

## 👋 About Me  

My name is **Sandeep**, a **senior Flutter developer** who’s been building mobile apps since the **J2ME** era.  
I’ve spent years developing products for clients — solving problems, meeting deadlines, and delivering results.  
But somewhere inside, there’s always been this quiet voice whispering — *“When will you build something of your own?”*

That’s how **Kitaab Kiosk** was born.

## 📖 Why Books?  

Books have been my lifelong companions — my teachers, escapes, and silent mentors.  
I’ve always felt a deep connection to the world of literature, not just as a reader but as a believer in the power of stories.  

I wanted to build something that could bring together **readers, listeners, authors, and publishers** —  
a complete **360° ecosystem** for everyone who loves or creates books.  

The idea sparked years ago but never took flight — until now.

## ⚡ The Challenge  

Inspired by the **75 Hard Challenge**, I decided to create my own version — a **180-Day Challenge**  
to build a product from **zero to production**, solo.  

Every task — requirement gathering, system design, app development, API building,  
content creation, social-media marketing — will be handled by me.  

It’s huge. It’s scary. But it’s also incredibly exciting.

## 💡 What Makes Kitaab Kiosk Unique  

- 📚 **Chapter-wise audiobook and text summaries**  
- ❤️ **Book library** with bookmarks, favorites, and offline reading  
- 👩‍💼 **Author & publisher profiles** — discover new voices and small publishers  
- 🛍️ **Marketplace** for selling and ordering books  
- ✍️ **Community space** for new writers to share their work  
- 💎 **Subscription model** for long-term sustainability  

It’s more than an app — it’s a *movement for book lovers*.

## 🧠 The Tech Behind the Dream  

I’ve been working with **Flutter** for 5 years — and I absolutely love it.  
It’s cross-platform, expressive, and feels like **painting with code**.  

Earlier, I relied on **Laravel**, **CodeIgniter**, and **MySQL** for backend work,  
but for Kitaab Kiosk I’m switching gears to the **MERN stack** — **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Next.js**.  

Using **Next.js** as a wrapper around Node APIs lets me share backend logic  
between the app and the admin panel, saving time and effort — and pushing me to learn modern tools hands-on.

## 🚀 The Journey Begins  

Building **Kitaab Kiosk** solo isn’t just about making an app.  
It’s about proving that **learning never stops**, that **consistency beats perfection**,  
and that passion still has a place in our busy, chaotic lives.  

At the end of these 180 days, I may not only have an app —  
I’ll have **a story**.  
A story of persistence, growth, and love for books.
